Create a TransactionList interface that has the methods getLastTransaction which returns a Transaction object, addTransaction which is void and takes a Transaction as a parameter, getTransactionByDate which takes a Date parameter and returns a Transaction object, and getAllTransactions which returns an ArrayList of Transaction objects.
Transaction objects should have sellerAccountNumber, buyerAccountNumber,amount, and 'date properties. The Account object should have name, address, accountNumber, and balance properties.
Implement the interface in a class called PaymentList. PaymentList should have an ArrayList property that contains all Transactions. It should implement all methods from the interface.
